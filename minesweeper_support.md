## Instruction
This is a classic mine sweeper game.

To win the game, you need to open every single field without a bomb.

You lose once you step on a bomb(ðŸ’£).

The number presented on each field shows how many bombs are around that field.

Single tap a field to open it.

Try not to open any field with a bomb.

Long tap a field to put a flag(ðŸš©) on it if you think there is a bomb.

Tap a flag(ðŸš©) to remove the flag.

The total number of bombs and a timer will be shown on top of all fields.

Enjoy!ðŸ¤ª
